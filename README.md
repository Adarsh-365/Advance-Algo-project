# Image Processing Web Application

An interactive image processing web application built with Python and Streamlit, showcasing a wide range of image processing techniques. This project allows users to apply various filters, enhancements, and transformations on images while learning about underlying image processing concepts.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This web application provides an intuitive interface to explore several image processing techniques. Key features include basic operations like resizing and flipping images, noise reduction methods, image compression algorithms, and more advanced topics like segmentation and enhancement.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1️⃣ Basic Operations
- Convert images to grayscale
- Adjust intensity of red, green, and blue channels individually
- Flip, sharpen, blur, invert, resize, and rescale images

### 2️⃣ Noise Reduction
- Explore noise types: 
  - Gaussian
  - Salt & Pepper
  - Speckle
  - Poisson
- Apply denoising techniques:
  - Gaussian Blur
  - Median Blur
  - Bilateral Filtering
  - Non-Local Means Denoising
  - Morphological Opening

### 3️⃣ Image Compression
- Learn about JPEG Compression and its underlying algorithm

### 4️⃣ Image Enhancement
- Enhance image contrast using Histogram Equalization

### 5️⃣ Image Segmentation
- Explore thresholding, Watershed Algorithm, contours, and k-means clustering for image segmentation
